#See and sort the changes in the crypto markets

#I built this as a portfolio project using vanilla Javascript, html and css.  It pulls data in via the coinranking API.

#You can see biggest gains, biggest losses, market averages all in one spot.  Select a timeframe to see the data from your selected time.  

#Each column can be selected to sort by the data inside it.
