See and sort the changes in the crypto markets

See it here https://cryptoataglance.netlify.app/

I built this as a portfolio project using vanilla
Javascript, html and css. It pulls data in via the
coinranking API.

You can see biggest gains, biggest losses, market averages
all in one spot. Select a timeframe to see the data from
your selected time.

Each column can be selected to sort by the data inside it.

Select the timeframe you want to see data from to see new
data.
